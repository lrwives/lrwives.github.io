# Headlands Outcrop: A Window into Ancient Shorelines

## Introduction

## Geographic Location
![Headlands_Location_Geography_v1.jpg]({{site.baseurl}}/_drafts/Headlands_Location_Geography_v1.jpg)

The sediments described here sit at a junction between two “spectacular” peninsulas and two Great Lakes.

The outcrop is located on the Lake Michigan shoreline at the southern end of the Headlands Dark Sky Park in Emmet County, Michigan. This shoreline marks the northern end of Trail’s End Bay, and is oriented east-west. The Headlands is located just west of the village of Mackinaw City, MI as well as the Mackinac Straits at the very northern tip of Michigan’s lower peninsula and just 4 miles south of the Upper Peninsula.

The Straits act as the boundary between Lake Michigan and Lake Huron. Though they cover a lot of area and have two different names, these two great lakes are hydrologically the same, since all the water in both Lake Michigan and Lake Huron can only exit through one outlet – the St. Clair River, north of Detroit.

## Geologic Setting and History of the Headlands

It will come as no surprise to people familiar with the geography of the Great Lakes that the landscape of northern Michigan was strongly shaped by the glaciers. What is not often discussed outside geoscience lecture rooms at colleges is:

- how the bedrock underlying Michigan and the Great Lakes laid the foundation for this whole story, and

- how the land was changed by the Great Lakes and other forces once the glaciers retreated north out of the region.

### Bedrock Geology

The bedrock geology of Michigan is important to this story in two ways – first in the creation of the Michigan-Huron Lake Basin and secondly in the creation of “highlands” north of, and within, the Straits. 

![Simplified map of the Michigan Basin (Luczaj and Masarik, 2015))]({{site.baseurl}}/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/279166236/figure/fig2/AS:669973299068928@1536745490208/Simplified-bedrock-geologic-map-for-the-western-US-Great-Lakes-region-showing-Wisconsin_W640.jpg)

The bedrock of Michigan’s lower peninsular and eastern upper peninsula are sedimentary rocks, mostly limestone, that were deposited/formed between ~550 - 300 million years (well before the age of the dinosaurs, which lasted from ~250 – 66 million years ago).

How and why these rocks formed is a story for another time. What’s important for our ice age glaciers is that some rocks are easy to erode and other rocks are literally too “hard” to erode. Where the Michigan-Huron Lake Basin is today was likely underlain by easy-for-glaciers-to-erode soft shales. If you trace the center of these two lakes, you’ll see that their shape mirror the “bullseye” pattern created by other rock layers in the Michigan Basin. On either side of the that soft layer, the rocks are much harder and were difficult to erode. In many cases this resulted in upland areas being preserved in the landscape. We see examples of these uplands all over the Straits, including Mackinac Island, Gros Cap, Castle Rock, Waugashance Point, all the submerged “reefs” that make navigating the Straits so difficult, and yes, even the Headlands.

If you’re familiar with the area you might be saying to yourself, “Hey! I thought those uplands were wave-cut bluffs, seas- arches, and sea-stacks!” – and you would be right. These uplands areas have been heavily modified by the wave action of the Great Lakes. But they were high points on the landscape first; The lakes did not make them high areas.

The lesson here is that the Headlands stand tall on the landscape, and the lake basins sit low, because of the type of bedrock that underlies them and how the glaciers interacted with that bedrock. Though you can’t see the bedrock on the surface at the Headlands, a well log from the property shows that limestone bedrock (likely the __ Fm) is only 15 feet below the surface. I realize that 15 feet is actually the height of a 1-story house, and may not seem that shallow, but the highest point at the Headlands is ~100 ft above the modern surface of Lake Michigan. So… still relatively tall.

I think it’s worth noting here that the large hills that make up the central and southern parts of Emmet County are not bedrock highlands. Those have a much different glacial origin.
Ice Age History
The formal definition of an “ice age” or “icehouse” climate is a period in Earth’s history of prolonged, low global temperatures that result in the formation of large, continent-sized glaciers in the high latitudes of both the northern and southern hemispheres. The ice sheet that overlies the continent of Antarctica likely reached roughly its modern extent first around 34 million years ago. The glaciation of Greenland really got going sometime around 3.5 million years ago, and the rest of the northern hemisphere (Alaska, Eurasia, etc.) about 1 million years later (Maslin and Adams). For reference, the first evidence for bipedalism in hominids comes from ~6 million years ago, and 2.5 million years ago we were just starting to use stone tools (Smithsonian). 
I tell you all this because in the Great Lakes region we often talk about “the last ice age” when discussing our modern landscape, but the phrase we should be using is “most recent glacial advance.” The world has been in an icehouse state for ~3.5 million years. During that time glaciers large and small have grown, shrunk, shaped, and re-shaped the surface of our planet over and over again. Glaciers that flowed out of Canada and into the northern United States have advanced and retreated numerous times during the last several millennia, sometimes reaching as far south as northern Missouri.

Glaciers are so effective at reshaping the landscape, that each time ice sheets re-advanced over the northern United States they erased much of the record from previous glacier advances and laid down whole new ones – like shaking an etch-a-sketch clean and drawing sometime brand new. Northern Michigan’s modern landscape, though influenced by glacial advances that occurred during the last 2.5 million years, was most directly shaped by the “most recent glacial advance”; or as we call it in the biz: “the last glacial maximum” or “LGM”. The glaciers began to retreat from their LGM position around 19,000 years ago. Again, to put this timeline in the context of human history, by 19,000 years ago homo sapiens were still several thousands of years away from developing agriculture. When you think of the motif of a group of people hunting mammoths with spears, the LGM is that time.

When the glaciers advanced across the Straits area during the LGM, they carved-out and deepened the Michigan-Huron Lake Basin, left behind some bedrock highs like the one at the Headlands, and deposited loads of new sediment.
