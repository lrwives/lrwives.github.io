## Introduction

Nothing gets a geologist more excited than a friend saying, “I think I saw a cool outcrop you might wanna look at.” And that’s exactly what Larry said when he stopped by to pick up his CSA share from my husband and I’s farm one Friday in late July.

Outcrops – exposures of rock and sediment - are a small, but integral piece of a larger, global puzzle. Understanding geology is all about fitting knowledge we can gather within a grain of sand together with regional and global perspectives to understand the forces that shape our world. These glimpses into our geologic past are even more exciting in a place like northern Michigan, where they usually don’t come along unless someone is digging a foundation or gravel pit. 
Imagine the earth as if it was a layered cake. The surface of our earth is the frosting – delicious and beautiful all on its own, and it can often tell us a lot about what kind of cake be beneath it. But it’s going to be difficult to know the cake’s flavor until you take that first slice. Looking at a geologic outcrop is similar to slicing open the cake; a chance to see what wonderful secrets are hiding inside.

Since Great Lake levels have been sitting high from the last several years, exposures of rock and sediment along the shores of Lake Michigan have become more common due to slope failure and erosion. While the 30-year cycle that bring high waters is hell for property owners, it’s a rare opportunity for geologists. As soon as those water levels retreat, we’ll get our beaches back and our homes will be safer, but the outcrops will become covered with sediment slumps and vegetation and we’ll lose our chance.

So, of course, on a day that we both felt we could use a little break, my husband Patrick and I went on a little adventure to Trail’s End Bay on Lake Michigan to check out Larry’s outcrop.
I’m going to tell you all about the outcrop in the second half of this post, but I think context is super important. Because of that belief, I spent some time putting together some basic background on the site to help you understand why this is such a neat outcrop.

## Geographic Location
![Headlands_Location_Geography_v1.jpg](https://github.com/lrwives/files/blob/6b3b992ce27e1ccf699c68d2f7a6189af04cdcd0/Headlands_Working_1_CloseUp.jpg)

The sediments described here sit at a junction between two “spectacular” peninsulas and two Great Lakes.

The outcrop is located on the Lake Michigan shoreline at the southern end of the Headlands Dark Sky Park in Emmet County, Michigan. This shoreline marks the northern end of Trail’s End Bay, and is oriented east-west. The Headlands is located just west of the village of Mackinaw City, MI as well as the Mackinac Straits at the very northern tip of Michigan’s lower peninsula and just 4 miles south of the Upper Peninsula.

The Straits act as the boundary between Lake Michigan and Lake Huron. Though they cover a lot of area and have two different names, these two great lakes are hydrologically the same, since all the water in both Lake Michigan and Lake Huron can only exit through one outlet – the St. Clair River, north of Detroit.

## Geologic Setting and History of the Headlands

It will come as no surprise to people familiar with the geography of the Great Lakes that the landscape of northern Michigan was strongly shaped by the glaciers. What is not often discussed outside geoscience lecture rooms at colleges is:

- how the bedrock underlying Michigan and the Great Lakes laid the foundation for this whole story, and

- how the land was changed by the Great Lakes and other forces once the glaciers retreated north out of the region.

### Bedrock Geology

The bedrock geology of Michigan is important to this story in two ways – first in the creation of the Michigan-Huron Lake Basin and secondly in the creation of “highlands” north of, and within, the Straits. 

![Simplified map of the Michigan Basin (Luczaj and Masarik, 2015))](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/279166236/figure/fig2/AS:669973299068928@1536745490208/Simplified-bedrock-geologic-map-for-the-western-US-Great-Lakes-region-showing-Wisconsin_W640.jpg)

The bedrock of Michigan’s lower peninsular and eastern upper peninsula are sedimentary rocks, mostly limestone, that were deposited/formed between ~550 - 300 million years (well before the age of the dinosaurs, which lasted from ~250 – 66 million years ago).

How and why these rocks formed is a story for another time. What’s important for our ice age glaciers is that some rocks are easy to erode and other rocks are literally too “hard” to erode. Where the Michigan-Huron Lake Basin is today was likely underlain by easy-for-glaciers-to-erode soft shales. If you trace the center of these two lakes, you’ll see that their shape mirror the “bullseye” pattern created by other rock layers in the Michigan Basin. On either side of the that soft layer, the rocks are much harder and were difficult to erode. In many cases this resulted in upland areas being preserved in the landscape. We see examples of these uplands all over the Straits, including Mackinac Island, Gros Cap, Castle Rock, Waugashance Point, all the submerged “reefs” that make navigating the Straits so difficult, and yes, even the Headlands.

[Map of the Straits Area showing these locations]

If you’re familiar with the area you might be saying to yourself, “Hey! I thought those uplands were wave-cut bluffs, sea-arches, and sea-stacks!” – and you would be right. These uplands areas have been heavily modified by the wave action of the Great Lakes. But they were high points on the landscape first; The lakes did not make them high areas.

![Mackinac Island Arch Rock from mackinacisland.org](https://www.mackinacisland.org/assets/rocks.jpg)

The lesson here is that the Headlands stand tall on the landscape, and the lake basins sit low, because of the type of bedrock that underlies them and how the glaciers interacted with that bedrock. Though you can’t see the bedrock on the surface at the Headlands, a [well log from the property](https://secure1.state.mi.us/WELLOGIC/ReportProxy.aspx/?/WELLOGIC/user_Well%20Record&rs:Command=Render&rs:Format=PDF&wellLogID=24000002637) shows that limestone bedrock is only 15 feet below the surface. I realize that 15 feet is actually the height of a 1-story house, and may not seem that shallow, but the highest point at the Headlands is ~100 ft above the modern surface of Lake Michigan. So… still relatively tall.

I think it’s worth noting here that the large hills that make up the central and southern parts of Emmet County are not bedrock highlands. Those have a much different glacial origin.

### Ice Age History

The formal definition of an “ice age” or “icehouse” climate is a period in Earth’s history of prolonged, low global temperatures that result in the formation of large, continent-sized glaciers in the high latitudes of both the northern and southern hemispheres. The ice sheet that overlies the continent of Antarctica likely reached roughly its modern extent first around 34 million years ago. The glaciation of Greenland really got going sometime around 3.5 million years ago, and the rest of the northern hemisphere (Alaska, Eurasia, etc.) about 1 million years later ([Maslin and Adams](https://www.esd.ornl.gov/projects/qen/onset.html)). For reference, the first evidence for bipedalism in hominids comes from ~6 million years ago, and 2.5 million years ago we were just starting to use stone tools ([Smithsonian](https://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/human-evolution-timeline-interactive)). 

I tell you all this because in the Great Lakes region we often talk about “the last ice age” when discussing our modern landscape, but the phrase we should be using is “most recent glacial advance.” The world has been in an icehouse state for ~3.5 million years. During that time glaciers large and small have grown, shrunk, shaped, and re-shaped the surface of our planet over and over again. Glaciers that flowed out of Canada and into the northern United States have advanced and retreated numerous times during the last several millennia, sometimes reaching as far south as northern Missouri.

![Map of glacial margins](https://cdn.britannica.com/18/64918-050-0AEEC9CB/areas-ice-sheets-Wisconsin-altitudes-Kansan-Nebraskan.jpg)

Glaciers are so effective at reshaping the landscape, that each time ice sheets re-advanced over the northern United States they erased much of the record from previous glacier advances and laid down whole new ones – like shaking an etch-a-sketch clean and drawing sometime brand new. Northern Michigan’s modern landscape, though influenced by glacial advances that occurred during the last 2.5 million years, was most directly shaped by the “most recent glacial advance”; or as we call it in the biz: “the last glacial maximum” or “LGM”. The glaciers began to retreat from their LGM position around 19,000 years ago. Again, to put this timeline in the context of human history, by 19,000 years ago homo sapiens were still several thousands of years away from developing agriculture. When you think of the motif of a group of people hunting mammoths with spears, the LGM is that time.

![Mammoth Hunt](https://www.thevintagenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/zxcneevx-1280x720.jpg)

When the glaciers advanced across the Straits area during the LGM, they carved-out and deepened the Michigan-Huron Lake Basin, left behind some bedrock highs like the one at the Headlands, and deposited loads of new sediment.

### After the Glaciers

## Geomorphic Context
You can tell a lot about the post-glacial history of the Headlands (or anywhere, really) by looking at elevation maps. The movements of glaciers, waves on a lake, or the currents in a river all leave behind unique and beautiful landforms that allow up to interpret past geologic/geomorphic events.

![LiDAR DEM and Hillshade of the Headlands Area](https://github.com/lrwives/files/blob/6b3b992ce27e1ccf699c68d2f7a6189af04cdcd0/Headlands_LiDAR_v1.jpg)


Most of the unique shapes in the landscape around the Headlands and Mackinaw City were formed along the shoreline of Lake Michigan as the water levels gradually fell over the last 5000 years -or -so (or, since ~3000 BCE in human years). Shorelines, whether in lakes or oceans, very often build and leave behind “beach ridges”, like you see on the map here. Beach ridges are usually built by waves where a shoreline is building out into the water – either due to the addition of sand, or the lowering of the water level. Beach ridge complexes (also known as ‘dune and swale’) are most common in bays, which by their nature have a very gradual slope. So, as water levels dropped in the Michigan-Huron basin, water gradually retreated out of Trails End Bay and left a series of beach ridges, like water rings in a bathtub. In some places, you can see where these beach ridges parted slightly from the shoreline’s trajectory to form spits and bars, and other familiar shoreline features. Lakes like French Farm Lake, Paradise (Carp) Lake, and Wycamp Lake, and many of the small lakes along the shores of Lake Michigan are old parts of an embayment that was once part of the Big Lake, but are now trapped behind these beach ridge complexes. If the sand left behind wasn’t vegetated quickly enough, these beach ridges were sometimes buffeted around by the wind and shaped into dunes. 

As you can see by the distribution of beach ridges around the Headlands and its neighbor to the south, both of these uplands were once surrounded by water and formed islands, much like Mackinac Island and Bois Blanc Island. The cliffs that ring the Headlands above the beach ridges formed when lake levels were parked at a single elevation for several thousands of years – likely during the period of the “Nippising Great Lakes”, a period between ~6,500 – 4,500 years ago during which Michigan-Huron Lake levels sat ~50 ft higher than they are today. This Nippising Interval is probably the period during which famous features, such as the wave-cut arch at Mackinac Island and the lake-stacks like Castle Rock, formed.

![Nippising Great Lakes reconstruction from MSU geography](http://geo.msu.edu/extra/geogmich/images/dg-49.GIF)

People were living around the Great Lakes during this time of high lake levels, which archaeologists have dubbed the “Archaic period” (8000 – 1000 BCE) and the “Woodland period”. (1000 BCE – 1000 CE). These communities left behind a legacy of stone, pottery, and (Keweenaw) copper belongings, as well as oral traditions and stories that they passed down to their decedents. The oral traditions of native tribes in the Great Lakes regions often include legends describing changes to the landscape, including the draining, flooding, and re-routing of lakes. I couldn’t find a lot of resources online that recount and describe these stories. Maybe someone can point me towards some?

Anyway, you might be asking “Why does she want me to know all about beach ridges and ancient lake levels?” The answer is: Because the outcrop I’m going to describe next is essentially a cross-section through a beach ridge that was made when lake levels were just a little higher than they are today. It’s also worth noting that lake-side outcrops like this are only likely to be well-exposed when lake levels are relatively high, like they are now. 

Here's a zoomed-in version of the map above showing the ridge a little better:

![Location Close-up](https://github.com/lrwives/files/blob/6b3b992ce27e1ccf699c68d2f7a6189af04cdcd0/Headlands_Working_1_CloseUp.jpg)

The outcrop Larry pointed me to is a little bluff that is cutting through an old, elevated beach ridge. The exposure along the lake give us an opportunity to see inside this ridge.

## Outcrop Description
In this first section, I’m only going to describe the outcrop and then I will tell you what I think it all means in the “Outcrop Interpretation” section. 

**Location: 42.771433˚ 084.782650˚W**


![DSC_4085.JPG](https://github.com/lrwives/files/blob/master/DSC_4085.JPG)

The outcrop is ~5 m, or ~16 ft., tall. The sediments exposed in the outcrop are an excellent example of what geologists call a “coarsening upward sequence”, where the sediments at the bottom a relatively fine-grained at the bottom (think clay or silt) and then gradually become more coarse (sand, gravel, etc.) as you move upward through the sediments without experiencing any major interruptions. Coarsening upward sequences suggest a couple of things:
1. Since there are no major interruptions in this pattern, **these sediments were probably all deposited in the same lake** and not, say, partially in a lake and partially in a river or glacier.

2. **There was a gradually increase in energy in the system through time.** There are couple of key geology ideas wrapped up in that statement, so let me break it down a little more:

- The sediments on the bottom were deposited first, followed by the overlying sediments, and so forth. So, the clay was deposited before the sand, which was deposited before the gravel.

- Each of these sediment sizes represents different amounts of energy. It takes more energy to move a big rock than a small rock. Rocks and sediments are moved by energy in the form of water, wind, and gravity. In water, energy comes in the form of waves and currents. Bigger waves and stronger currents will move big rocks as well as small rocks, silt and clay. Medium-sized/strength waves or currents can move the medium and small stuff, but not the big stuff, and so on. 

Ergo, there wasn’t a lot of energy around when the finer-grained (clay, silt) sediments were deposited, but there was a lot of energy present when the gravel was deposited. The sand in the middle of the section shows a time of medium-energy.

What I’m going to do next is talk about each sediment layer, starting at the bottom and moving through to the top.

### Layer 1: Lake Clays with Organics, ~0-1.5 ft.

This interval is composed to grey sandy clay loam with thin organic mat layers. The unoxidized grey sediments oxidize to reddish-brown. Whole shells and shelly fragments are common. Shells include bivalves (e.g. clams/muscles) and gastropods (snails).

![clay and organic layers](https://github.com/lrwives/files/blob/6b3b992ce27e1ccf699c68d2f7a6189af04cdcd0/clay%20and%20mud%20layers.jpg)

The organic layers are 1 mm – 2 cm thick, and laterally discontinuous. The mats are black in color and contain plant macrofossils that someone with a better background in plants than myself may be able to identify. These macrofossils included pieces of wood.

![wood fragment from organic layer with black unidentifiable black material and small gastropods on it.](https://github.com/lrwives/files/blob/master/DSC_4096.JPG)


### Layer 2: Lake Clays without Organics, ~1.5-3 ft.

Moving upward through this clay layer, the organic mats gradually become rarer and then disappear altogether. In this interval, shells also become less common, but within the clay one can find rare pebbles, which are notably not made of limestone (this will become important later).

![pebbles found in the clay](https://github.com/lrwives/files/blob/master/DSC_4097.JPG)

### Layer 3: Fine sand and loam, ~3-5 ft.

In the next layer up, the sand continues to become coarser. The sand in this layer is still mostly made of quartz, but now also contains a lot more limestone sand, shell fragments, and other types of rocks, much like the sand along modern beaches in the area. 

![DSC_4101.JPG](https://github.com/lrwives/files/blob/master/DSC_4101.JPG)


### Layer 4: Fine to medium sand, ~5-7 ft.

In the next layer up, the sand continues to become coarser. The sand in this layer is still mostly made of quartz, but now also contains a lot more limestone sand, shell fragments, and other types of rocks, much like the sand along modern beaches in the area. 

Though they are difficult to see, there are some bands in these sandy sediments – “cross beds” – that point in the direction water was flowing when the sediments were lain down. The cross beds in these layers point roughly to the south-south east, a direction that is perpendicular to the trend of the old beach ridge we can see in the elevation data.

![DSC_4091.JPG](https://github.com/lrwives/files/blob/master/DSC_4091.JPG)

![DSC_4104.JPG](https://github.com/lrwives/files/blob/master/DSC_4104.JPG)

### Layer 5: Coarse sand, ~7-9 ft.

The next layer is a continuation of the sandy layers below, but now the sand grains are much larger. There are fewer whole fossil shells, but a similar number of bone fragments. Cross beds continue to dip roughly towards the south-south east.

![DSC_4106.JPG](https://github.com/lrwives/files/blob/master/DSC_4106.JPG)

### Layer 6: Gravel, ~9 ft.+

The gravel layer that tops this coarsening upward sequence is ~6 ft thick. The clasts continue to get larger all the way to the top of the gravel. The gravel is made almost wholly of limestone cobbles and boulders, with small amounts of chert (which forms in limestones), granite, and black-colored igneous and metamorphic rocks. Clasts within the conglomerate are roughly imbricated - aligned with one another, suggesting some current or wave pushed them in a preferred orientation. The cobbles and boulders are not particularly well-rounded, or smooth. Sand similar to that in Layer 5 fills in the gaps around the boulders.

![DSC_4112.JPG](https://github.com/lrwives/files/blob/master/DSC_4112.JPG)

### Adjacent Areas

When we visited the outcrop, we got to it by walking along the Lake Michigan shoreline. While doing this we noticed that most exposures along the lakeshore are composed of only Layer 1 (mud) and Layer 6 (gravel). This tell us that the sandy layers (Layers 2 – 5) are the ones that created the beach ridge, while the environments that allowed the muddy sediments at the bottom of the sequence and the course cobbles at the top of the sequence occurred not only on the beach ridge, but also in the surrounding areas.

## Interpretation
